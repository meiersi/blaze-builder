-- Module:      Blaze.ByteString.Builder

--
-- "Blaze.ByteString.Builder" is the main module, which you should import as a user
-- of the @blaze-builder@ library.
--
-- > import Blaze.ByteString.Builder
--
-- It provides you with a type 'Builder' that allows to efficiently construct
-- lazy bytestrings with a large average chunk size.
--
-- Intuitively, a 'Builder' denotes the construction of a part of a lazy
-- bytestring. Builders can either be created using one of the primitive
-- combinators in "Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Write" or by using one of the predefined
-- combinators for standard Haskell values (see the exposed modules of this
-- package).  Concatenation of builders is done using 'mappend' from the
-- 'Monoid' typeclass.
--
-- Here is a small example that serializes a list of strings using the UTF-8
-- encoding.
--
-- @ import "Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Char.Utf8"@
--
-- > strings :: [String]
-- > strings = replicate 10000 "Hello there!"
--
-- The function @'fromString'@ creates a 'Builder' denoting the UTF-8 encoded
-- argument. Hence, UTF-8 encoding and concatenating all @strings@ can be done
-- follows.
--
-- > concatenation :: Builder
-- > concatenation = mconcat $ map fromString strings
--
-- The function 'toLazyByteString'  can be used to execute a 'Builder' and
-- obtain the resulting lazy bytestring.
--
-- > result :: L.ByteString
-- > result = toLazyByteString concatenation
--
-- The @result@ is a lazy bytestring containing 10000 repetitions of the string
-- @\"Hello there!\"@ encoded using UTF-8. The corresponding 120000 bytes are
-- distributed among three chunks of 32kb and a last chunk of 6kb.
--
-- /A note on history./ This serialization library was inspired by the
-- @Data.Binary.Builder@ module provided by the @binary@ package. It was
-- originally developed with the specific needs of the @blaze-html@ package in
-- mind. Since then it has been restructured to serve as a drop-in replacement
-- for @Data.Binary.Builder@, which it improves upon both in speed as well as
-- expressivity.

-- | Run a 'Builder' with the given buffer sizes.
--
-- Use this function for integrating the 'Builder' type with other libraries
-- that generate lazy bytestrings.
--
-- Note that the builders should guarantee that on average the desired chunk
-- size is attained. Builders may decide to start a new buffer and not
-- completely fill the existing buffer, if this is faster. However, they should
-- not spill too much of the buffer, if they cannot compensate for it.
--
-- FIXME: Note that the following paragraphs are not entirely correct as of
-- blaze-builder-0.4:
--
-- A call @toLazyByteStringWith bufSize minBufSize firstBufSize@ will generate
-- a lazy bytestring according to the following strategy. First, we allocate
-- a buffer of size @firstBufSize@ and start filling it. If it overflows, we
-- allocate a buffer of size @minBufSize@ and copy the first buffer to it in
-- order to avoid generating a too small chunk. Finally, every next buffer will
-- be of size @bufSize@. This, slow startup strategy is required to achieve
-- good speed for short (<200 bytes) resulting bytestrings, as for them the
-- allocation cost is of a large buffer cannot be compensated. Moreover, this
-- strategy also allows us to avoid spilling too much memory for short
-- resulting bytestrings.
--
-- Note that setting @firstBufSize >= minBufSize@ implies that the first buffer
-- is no longer copied but allocated and filled directly. Hence, setting
-- @firstBufSize = bufSize@ means that all chunks will use an underlying buffer
-- of size @bufSize@. This is recommended, if you know that you always output
-- more than @minBufSize@ bytes.
