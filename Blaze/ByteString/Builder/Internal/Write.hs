-- Poking a buffer and writing to a buffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Sadly GHC is not smart enough: code where we branch and each branch should
-- execute a few IO actions and then return a value cannot be taught to GHC. At
-- least not such that it returns the value of the branches unpacked.
--
-- Hmm.. at least he behaves much better for the Monoid instance of Write
-- than the one for Poke. Serializing UTF-8 chars gets a slowdown of a
-- factor 2 when 2 chars are composed. Perhaps I should try out the writeList
-- instances also, as they may be more sensitive to to much work per Char.

-- | Changing a sequence of bytes starting from the given pointer. 'Poke's are
-- the most primitive buffer manipulation. In most cases, you don't use the
-- explicitely but as part of a 'Write', which also tells how many bytes will
-- be changed at most.

-- | A write of a bounded number of bytes.
--
-- When defining a function @write :: a -> Write@ for some @a@, then it is
-- important to ensure that the bound on the number of bytes written is
-- data-independent. Formally,
--
--  @ forall x y. getBound (write x) = getBound (write y) @
--
-- The idea is that this data-independent bound is specified such that the
-- compiler can optimize the check, if there are enough free bytes in the buffer,
-- to a single subtraction between the pointer to the next free byte and the
-- pointer to the end of the buffer with this constant bound of the maximal
-- number of bytes to be written.
